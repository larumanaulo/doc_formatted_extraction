BASE_PROMPT = """
    You are an expert insurance document extraction assistant.

    Your task is to extract structured data from Business Auto insurance documents that vary in layout, terminology, and formatting.

    Instructions:
    - Focus only on the "Business Auto" section (may also be labeled "Automobile").
    - Ignore all other coverages (e.g., Commercial Property, Workers Compensation).
    - Handle variations in terminology (e.g., “Liability Limit” vs. “Business Auto Liability Limit”).
    - Handle optional fields gracefully: if a value is not found, return `null`.
    - Do not infer values only extract what is explicitly stated.
    - Output must conform exactly to the field names and structure provided in the user prompt.

COVERAGE_DATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
    Task: 
    From this document: 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    {{data}}

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Extract coverage information from the provided Business Auto Coverage section. Use domain knowledge to handle variations in terminology and layout. 

    Return a JSON object with the following fields:
    - liabilityInsuranceLimit: Liability limit
    - liabilityInsuranceSymbol: Liability symbol
    - medicalPaymentsLimit: Medical Payments limit
    - medicalPaymentsSymbol: Medical Payments symbol
    - uninsuredMotoristLimit: Uninsured Motorist limit
    - uninsuredMotoristSymbol: Uninsured Motorist symbol
    - underinsuredMotoristLimit: Underinsured Motorist limit
    - underinsuredMotoristSymbol: Underinsured Motorist symbol
    - personalInjuryProtectionLimit: Personal Injury Protection limit
    - personalInjuryProtectionSymbol: Personal Injury Protection symbol
    - hiredAutoLimit: Hired Auto limit
    - hiredAutoSymbol: Hired Auto symbol
    - nonOwnedAutoLiabilityLimit: Non-Owned Auto Liability limit
    - nonOwnedAutoLiabilitySymbol: Non-Owned Auto Liability symbol
    - collisionLimit: Collision limit
    - collisionDeductible: Collision deductible
    - comprehensiveLimit: Comprehensive limit
    - comprehensiveDeductible: Comprehensive deductible

    Important Terminology Notes:
    - Liability: May appear as “Combined Single Limit”, “Auto Liability”, “Business Auto Liability”
    - Medical Payments: May be listed as “Med Pay”, “Medical Pay”
    - Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist: May be abbreviated as “UM” and “UIM”
    - Personal Injury Protection: May appear as “PIP”
    - Collision & Comprehensive: May appear as “Physical Damage”, “Other Than Collision”, or “OTC”
    - Symbols may be listed separately from the coverages

    If no coverage or symbol is found for a field, return null.

DRIVER_SCHEDULE_DATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
    Task:
    From the document text provided below, extract the **driver schedule** section and return it in structured JSON format.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    {{data}}

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    ### Output Format:
    Return a JSON object structured as:
    ```json
    {
    "driverSchedule": [
        {
        "fullName": "string",
        "dateOfBirth": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
        "licenseNumber": "string or null"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
    Extraction Rules:
    Extract all listed drivers, even if only names are available.

    If date of birth or license number are redacted, masked, or suppressed, return null for those fields.

    Driver names may appear:

    In a block under headings like:
    “Driver Schedule”
    “Schedule of Drivers”
    “Named Drivers”
    “Operators” or “Personnel”

    Or with no formal section heading — use name patterns (e.g., "First Last", comma-separated names, or lines with multiple names)
    Treat grouped names (e.g., Jake Robin) as separate drivers.
    Avoid duplicates — if the same driver is repeated, include only once.
    Do not guess or infer values — extract only what is visible in the text.

    Additional Notes:
    Section titles may be missing; rely on contextual clues (e.g., clusters of names near suppressed data indicators or mentions like "Driver List").

    If no drivers are found or the section is blank, return:
    { "driverSchedule": [] }

VEHICLE_SCHEDULE_DATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
    Task: 
    From this document: 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    {{data}}

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Extract the vehicle schedule from the provided Business Auto document text.

    Return a JSON object with a key "vehicleSchedule" which is an array of vehicle objects with the following fields:

    - year: vehicle year (e.g., "2020")
    - make: vehicle make (e.g., "FORD")
    - model: vehicle model (e.g., "F150")
    - vin: Vehicle Identification Number
    - vehiclePremium: premium associated with this vehicle
    - vehicleCost: vehicle's cost or value

    Instructions:
    - Extract all vehicles listed not just a sample.
    - Return `null` for any missing values (e.g., VIN not listed).
    - Vehicle schedules may appear under different section titles like:
    - “Vehicle Schedule”
    - “Schedule of Autos”
    - “Covered Autos”
    - Some vehicles may appear in tabular form or as blocks of text.
    - Do not infer values. Only return those explicitly listed.

EVALUATION_PROMPT = """
    You are a senior QA analyst specializing in Business Auto insurance document extraction.

    Your task is to **critically evaluate** whether the structured JSON output accurately reflects the source insurance document text which may use inconsistent layouts, terminology, or abbreviations.

    You are evaluating the extraction based on:

    1. **Completeness** Are all required fields present (even if null)?
    2. **Accuracy** Do the extracted values (e.g., limits, deductibles, VINs) exactly match those in the text?
    3. **Structure** Does the JSON follow the correct schema structure, including nesting and naming?

    Your domain knowledge should include:
    - Common variations in field names (e.g., "Combined Single Limit", "CSL", "Auto Liability")
    - Tabular layouts with or without headers
    - Optional fields like UM/UIM, Medical Payments, or PIP that may be redacted or suppressed
    - Vehicle and driver schedules listed in nonstandard formats

    ### Instructions:
    - Do **not guess or infer** any values evaluate only what is present.
    - Use **minor tolerance** for OCR formatting differences (e.g., "$5000" vs. "5000").
    - Treat missing fields, inaccurate values, or extra hallucinated values as **explicit issues**.
    - Be very specific when reporting mismatches or omissions.

    ### Output Format:
    Return a strict JSON object:
    {
    "score": 0-100,
    "issues": [
        "Missing Field: medicalPaymentsSymbol not extracted.",
        "Mismatch: liabilityInsuranceLimit is $100,000 but should be $1,000,000.",
        "Extra Field: UninsuredMotoristLimit was returned but not found in the document."
    ],
    "summary": "The extraction was structurally valid and mostly complete, but it missed symbols and slightly mismatched liability limits."

    You are a senior prompt engineer specializing in insurance document extraction optimization.

    Task:
    Based on the summary and issue list from an evaluation of a failed extraction attempt, suggest **targeted improvements** to the original extraction prompt that could help the model perform better in future runs.

    - Be **short, specific, and actionable**

    You may include suggestions like:
    - Adding synonyms or formatting variations for key fields
    - Clarifying how to handle table structures or missing headers
